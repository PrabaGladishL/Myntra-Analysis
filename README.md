In this project, I have analyzed Myntra's business model, market position, growth strategies, and customer feedback. 
I have explored how Myntra, after being acquired by Flipkart, transitioned into a major player in fashion e-commerce, offering products from over 3,000 brands, including private labels like Roadster and HRX. 
The analysis highlighted Myntra’s revenue generation through product sales, advertising, and logistics services, showing strong growth driven by mobile-first strategies, personalized AI recommendations, and sales events like the Big Fashion Festival.
The SWOT analysis identified Myntra’s strengths, such as its vast product range and innovative technology, but also pointed out weaknesses like intense competition and customer service issues. 
I have provided strategic recommendations for improving pricing transparency, logistics, customer support, and product authenticity, aiming to enhance customer experience and boost revenue.
Overall, the project demonstrates Myntra’s ability to grow while addressing operational challenges.
